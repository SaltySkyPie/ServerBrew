# Server Brew

## Description
A simple proof of concept, that monohlithic applications is the best way for 99% of the cases.

Microservices are just useless complexity for most of the cases. Like for what reason would you want to do something like this, if you can achieve the same thing in 20 minutes of coding and 40 minutes of styling?


Why only have 4 views, 4 templates and 4 urls when you can design an abomination of a project with half of AWS services. (https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-coffee)

That repository is pure useless complexity, and it's a perfect example of what not to do.
